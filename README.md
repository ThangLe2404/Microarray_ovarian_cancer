# Microarray_ovarian_cancer
The aim of this analysis was to find the characterize of microarray profile of normal and ovarian cancer; Then proceed to identify important molecular markers to distinguish these two cell types.
1. Describe data:
### a) Distribution data analysis
### b) Examine the number of cancer and normal cell samples
2. Plot clustermap to visualize data of gene expression to identify microarray profile:
### a) Ovarian Cancer 
### b) Normal cell
3. Split data into training and testing set
   a) 80% for training and validation
   b) 20% for testing
4. Train and validation model 
   a) RandomForest 
   b) LogisticRegression model
5. Evaluate model using testing set
6. Explain impact of gene by using feature importance
